# Algorithms and Datastructures Course Repository

## Repository Structure
This repository is structured as follows:

* There is a directory for each learning block (based on Moodle blocks) containing the code presented in-class
  * E.g.: <b>1 Programming Introduction</b> has its corresponding ``/01_lecture`` directory
* Each lecture/directory has multiple ``.py`` files which are chronologically ordered
  * E.g.: ``/01_lecture`` has a `01printing.py`, `02user_input.py` and so on
* Each directory has a sub directory named ``/exercises`` which provides you with exercises for each topic
  * E.g.: ``/01_lecture/exercises/01_printing.py``
