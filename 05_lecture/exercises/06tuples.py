Write a function named create_tuple(x: int, y: int, z: int), which takes three integers as its arguments,
and creates and returns a tuple based on the following criteria:

    The first element in the tuple is the smallest of the arguments
    The second element in the tuple is the greatest of the arguments
    The third element in the tuple is the sum of the arguments

An example of its use:
    print(create_tuple(5, 3, -1))   # (-1, 5, 7)

Write a function named oldest_person(people: list), which takes a list of tuples as its argument. 
In each tuple, the first element is the name of a person, and the second element is their year of birth. 
The function should find the oldest person on the list and return their name.

An example of the function in action:

    p1 = ("Adam", 1977)
    p2 = ("Ellen", 1985)
    p3 = ("Mary", 1953)
    p4 = ("Ernest", 1997)
    people = [p1, p2, p3, p4]
    
    print(oldest_person(people))    # Mary

"""
In this exercise we are handling tuples just like the ones described in the previous exercise.

Write a function named older_people(people: list, year: int), which selects all those people on the list who were 
born before the year given as an argument. The function should return the names of these people in a new list.

An example of its use:
    p1 = ("Adam", 1977)
    p2 = ("Ellen", 1985)
    p3 = ("Mary", 1953)
    p4 = ("Ernest", 1997)
    people = [p1, p2, p3, p4]
    
    older = older_people(people, 1979)
    print(older)    # [ 'Adam', 'Mary' ]
